.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\fBrlzparse\fR
program compresses an input file against a dictionary, using the
Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ) algorithm.
The dictionary may be built in various ways, for example with the
builddict(1)
program that comes as a part of rlztools.
(See section
\fIDictionary\ generation\fR
for a quick discussion on dictionary generation.)
\fBrlzparse\fR
also needs the precomputed suffix array of the dictionary; see section
\fISuffix\ array\ computation\fR
for pointers on how to do that.
.PP
The
\fBrlzunparse\fR
program uncompresses files compressed with
\fBrlzparse\fR.
The same dictionary that was used for compression must also be used for
decompression, otherwise the output is garbage.
The suffix array is not required for decompression.
.PP
By default,
\fBrlzparse\fR
writes its output into a file with the name of the input plus the extension
".rlz", but the output file can be named explicitly with
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput-file\fR.
Giving the output file an ".rlz" extension is recommended.
.PP
Options can be given in any order.
All single-character short options also have a long name alias.
The options are as follows:
.TP 8n
\fB\-a\fR \fIfrom-index\fR, \fB\-\-from\fR \fIfrom-index\fR
\fBrlzunparse\fR
only.
Start decompression at the symbol at index
\fIfrom-index\fR.
Indices refer to positions in the original, uncompressed file.
The first character has an index of 1.
Both
\fB\-a\fR
and
\fB\-b\fR
indices are inclusive:
giving both the same argument produces a 1-symbol output file.
Specifying an index of 0 is the same as not specifying this option at all:
compression starts at the beginning of the file.
.TP 8n
\fB\-b\fR \fIto-index\fR, \fB\-\-to\fR \fIto-index\fR
Stop decompression at the symbol at index
\fIto-index\fR.
Indices are 1-based and inclusive.
Specifying an index of 0 is the same as not specifying this option at all:
compression continues to the end of the file.
.TP 8n
\fB\-d\fR \fIdictionary\fR, \fB\-\-dictionary\fR \fIdictionary\fR
Specifies the filename of the dictionary. Mandatory for both
\fBrlzparse\fR
and
\fBrlzunparse\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-f\fR \fB32x2\fR | \fB64x2\fR | \fBascii\fR | \fBvbyte\fR
Specifies the binary format of the RLZ output.
"32x2" and "64x2" both consist of fixed-width little-endian integers,
"ascii" is a textual format useful mainly for debugging or satisfying curiosity,
and "vbyte" is typically the most efficient format, having a variable number
of bytes per integer.
.TP 8n
\fB\-\-help\fR
Prints out a help message, listing a summary of options.
.TP 8n
\fB\-i\fR \fIinput-file\fR, \fB\-\-infile\fR \fIinput-file\fR
Specifies the file to be compressed or decompressed.
.TP 8n
\fB\-\-input-fmt\fR \fB32x2\fR | \fB64x2\fR | \fBascii\fR | \fBvbyte\fR
An alias of
\fB\-f\fR
in
\fBrlzunparse\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput-file\fR, \fB\-\-outfile\fR \fIoutput-file\fR
Specifies the name of the output file (compressed RLZ file in
\fBrlzparse\fR,
uncompressed file in
\fBrlzunparse\fR).
Mandatory in
\fBrlzunparse\fR.
Optional in
\fBrlzparse\fR;
if left unspecified, the output will have the name of the input plus the
suffix ".rlz".
.TP 8n
\fB\-\-output-fmt\fR \fB32x2\fR | \fB64x2\fR | \fBascii\fR | \fBvbyte\fR
An alias of
\fB\-f\fR
in
\fBrlzparse\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-\-progress\fR
\fBrlzparse\fR
only.
Periodically prints out a message on compression progress and speed.
.TP 8n
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Don't print any messages on stderr in normal operation.
In error cases an error message will still be printed.
Overrides \fB\-\-progress\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-s\fR \fIsuffix-array\fR, \fB\-\-suffix-array\fR \fIsuffix-array\fR
Specifies the suffix array's filename.
Mandatory for
\fBrlzparse\fR.
Unnecessary (and missing) in
\fBrlzunparse\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-W\fR \fB32\fR | \fB64\fR, \fB\-\-sa-width\fR \fB32\fR | \fB64\fR
\fBrlzparse\fR
only.
Sets the symbol width of suffix array elements.
The default is "32" \(em that is, 32 bits per integer, unsigned, little-endian.
"64" is only necessary for dictionaries larger than 2^32\-1 elements.
.TP 8n
\fB\-w\fR \fB8\fR | \fB16\fR | \fB32\fR | \fB64\fR, \fB\-\-width\fR \fB8\fR | \fB16\fR | \fB32\fR | \fB64\fR
Sets the symbol width of the uncompressed file and the dictionary.
See
\fISymbol\ width\fR
for the implications of this.
.SS "Dictionary\ generation"
Dictionary generation is a large topic in and of itself.
Depending on what the input data "looks like", various schemes may work.
If the input consists of a concatenated collection of a number of
largely-similar documents, a few of those documents may work.
For less-structured files, random sampling may be used; the
builddict(1)
program, supplied as a part of the rlztools, can be used for this.
.PP
Parameterizing the random sampler is a complex topic, but a few rules of thumb
are: don't make the sample length too short (a kilobyte/kilosymbol or few is
a good starting point), and a slightly too large dictionary is better than
a slightly too small one.
(Doubling the dictionary's size might not halve the compressed output's length,
but halving the dictionary's size is likely to make the compressed output
more than double in length.)
A dictionary between 1% and 10% of the uncompressed file's size is likely to
work quite well, and is a reasonable starting point.
.SS "Suffix\ array\ computation"
Suffix arrays must be computed by an external tool \(em suffix array computation
is not yet implemented in
\fBrlzparse\fR
itself, and even if implemented, is likely to not be as fast as other tools.
We have used the "gensa" program, part of "libdivsufsort" by Yuta Mori
(\fBhttps://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort\fR),
for suffix array calculation; it has proven to be fast and efficient for
dictionaries up to at least a few hundred megabytes in size.
.PP
Computing suffix arrays for wide-symbol data, in a way that will work with the
\fB\-w\fR
option, is not directly trivial, but is doable with a few utility tools
(and plenty of scratch space available on your disk).
These tools are included as part of the rlztools suite;
we refer you to the manual of
rlztools.divsuffix(1)
for examples on how to carry out the computation.
.SS "Symbol\ width"
By default, both utilities assume that the RLZ-compressed output or input is
in the "32x2" binary format, which uses a constant eight bytes per RLZ phrase.
Most real-world inputs will compress into a 30\(em60% smaller space
if compressed with the "vbyte" binary format, which varies the number of bytes
per phrase as needed.
If very large dictionaries bigger than 4\~GiB are used, this is no longer
sufficient, and either the "vbyte" or "64x2" binary formats must be used.
The choice of RLZ binary format is specified with the
\fB\-f\fR
option.
Take care to give
\fBrlzunparse\fR
the same
\fB\-f\fR
option as was used for compression; otherwise the program will probably crash,
or at the very least your output will be garbage.
.PP
By default, these tools assume that the original uncompressed file
(and the dictionary) are composed of 8-bit bytes.
This is fine for all inputs, but in some situations the input (and dictionary)
are in fact composed of wider units, like 32-bit (4-byte) fixed-width integers.
Both tools support interpreting the file as a sequence of these wider symbols:
the
\fB\-w\fR
option specifies the symbol width of both the dictionary and the input
(\fBrlzparse\fR)
or output
(\fBrlzunparse\fR).
This changes the interpretation of the
\fB\-a\fR
and
\fB\-b\fR
options, and the requirements of the suffix array.
.PP
For example, with
"\fB\-w\fR \fB32\fR"
set, the elements of the suffix array point to 32-bit symbols rather than
individual bytes, and thus one can use 32-bit-wide suffix arrays with
dictionaries as large as 16~GiB (2^32\-1 32-bit symbols).
Again with
"\fB\-w\fR \fB32\fR"
set, giving
\fBrlzunparse\fR
the parameters
"\fB\-a\fR \fB\-3000\fR \fB\-b\fR \fB\-3500\fR"
will result in a 2004-byte file (2004 bytes = 501 32-bit/4-byte symbols),
which starts at the 3000th symbol (i.e. the 12,000th byte)
in the original, uncompressed input file.
